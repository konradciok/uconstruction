## Order of execution

1. 1‚Äì4 (correctness) ‚Üí 5‚Äì7 (UX) ‚Üí 8‚Äì10 (a11y/perf/images) ‚Üí 11‚Äì13 (cleanup)
2. Type-check, lint, and build after step 7; second pass after cleanup.

## Test checklist

- Product page loads, no TS errors, no console errors.
- Gallery: zoom hover, swipe, lightbox open/close/Esc; thumbnails select; fallback image visible when missing media.
- Sticky Bar: appears on mobile only when CTA out of view; quantity changes update button; add-to-cart opens modal; totals correct.
- Buy Box: variant selection updates price; quantity stepper works; add-to-cart succeeds and modal opens.
- A11y: No duplicate IDs; lightbox focus/esc; buttons are real buttons (not divs).
- Performance: No visible jank; reduced-motion respected.
