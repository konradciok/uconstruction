# Product Page Refactor — Desktop (PDP)

_Last updated: 2025-09-15_  
_Status: Phase 1A & 1B COMPLETED ✅ | Phase 2 Ready_

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive refactor of the desktop Product Detail Page (fine art prints) to increase conversion rates through improved purchase flow hierarchy, clearer variant selection, and enhanced trust signals. Current implementation analysis shows solid foundation with specific gaps requiring targeted improvements.

## Context & Current State Analysis
### Current Strengths
- ✅ Solid component architecture with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Responsive CSS Grid system (mobile-first approach)
- ✅ Clean CSS module structure with consistent naming
- ✅ Accessibility considerations (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML)
- ✅ Performance optimizations (Next.js Image, proper loading states)

### Critical Issues Identified
1. ✅ ~~**Primary actions lack hierarchy**~~ — **FIXED:** Price prominent with large typography, full-width CTA button
2. ✅ ~~**Variant (size) selection unclear**~~ — **FIXED:** "Size" label, cm/in mapping, size guide modal
3. ✅ ~~**Reassurance buried**~~ — **FIXED:** Trust signals moved directly under CTA in buy box
4. **Gallery layout inefficient** — horizontal thumbnails waste vertical space _(Phase 2)_
5. **No sticky purchase controls** — CTA not persistent on scroll _(Phase 3)_
6. ✅ ~~**Content structure linear**~~ — **FIXED:** Progressive disclosure with organized accordion sections
7. ✅ ~~**Quantity control suboptimal**~~ — **FIXED:** Professional stepper component with validation
8. ✅ ~~**Mobile impact undefined**~~ — **ADDRESSED:** All P0 components fully responsive

---

## Objectives & Success Framework
### Primary Goals
- **Increase Add‑to‑Cart rate (ATC%)** by clarifying purchase flow and surfacing reassurance near CTA
- **Improve variant engagement** through clearer size selection with dimensional mapping
- **Strengthen trust signals** via strategic placement of quality, shipping, and authenticity cues
- **Enhance scannability** with progressive disclosure and tighter information hierarchy
- **Maintain accessibility** while improving visual hierarchy and interaction patterns

### Success Metrics & Baselines
**Pre-Launch Baseline Collection (14 days):**
- Current ATC rate by device type and traffic source
- Size selection abandonment rate (variant selector engagement)
- Average time to first scroll and CTA visibility duration
- Gallery interaction patterns (image clicks, zoom usage)
- Page bounce rate and session depth

**Target Improvements:**
- **ATC%:** +10–20% (establish baseline first)
- **Size selection completion:** +15% (currently ~40% abandon at variant selection)
- **CTA above-fold visibility:** +15% more sessions (target: 80% see CTA without scroll)
- **Gallery engagement:** +10% (zoom, thumbnail clicks)
- **Page bounce rate:** −5–10%

### Enhanced Analytics Instrumentation
**Core Events:** `pdp_view`, `size_select`, `qty_change`, `add_to_cart_click`, `sticky_bar_show`, `accordion_open`, `image_zoom_open`

**Additional Tracking:** `size_guide_open`, `reassurance_hover`, `variant_unavailable_click`, `price_visibility_time`, `cta_scroll_distance`, `mobile_sticky_show`

---

## Data Requirements & Content Strategy

### Size Dimension Mapping
**Required Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "variants": [
    {
      "id": "variant_123",
      "title": "A4",
      "dimensions": {
        "cm": "21 × 29.7",
        "inches": "8.3 × 11.7"
      },
      "availableForSale": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Content Migration Strategy
**Current Linear Content → Accordion Structure:**

1. **Description Accordion**
   - Product story and artistic details
   - Preserve HTML formatting from current description
   - Default: Closed (unless short content)

2. **Technical Details Accordion**  
   - Paper type, printing method, color profile
   - Dimensions, weight, archival properties
   - Certificate of authenticity details

3. **Shipping & Returns Accordion**
   - Shipping methods and timeframes
   - Return policy and process
   - International shipping information

### Trust Signal Content
**Reassurance Bullets (Position: Under CTA):**
- "Museum-quality giclée on archival paper"
- "Ships in 3-5 business days from EU/US"
- "Free shipping over $50 · Easy 30-day returns"

**Additional Trust Signals (Position: Technical Details):**
- Certificate of authenticity included
- Fade-resistant pigment inks
- Acid-free, cotton-fiber paper

## Risk Mitigation & Technical Considerations

### 🚨 High-Risk Changes & Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Gallery Layout Restructure (P1-A)
**Risk:** Vertical thumbnail layout requires major CSS Grid changes across all breakpoints
**Mitigation:**
- Implement feature flag for gradual rollout
- Create fallback to current horizontal layout
- Test mobile adaptation extensively (thumbnails may need to collapse/scroll horizontally)
- Performance testing for image loading patterns

#### 2. Content Migration to Accordions (P0-B)
**Risk:** SEO impact from hiding content, screen reader navigation changes
**Mitigation:**
- Implement progressive enhancement (content visible without JS)
- Use proper ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`)
- Test with multiple screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Monitor search rankings for 2 weeks post-launch

#### 3. Sticky Controls Implementation (P1-B)
**Risk:** Performance impact from scroll listeners, layout shifts
**Mitigation:**
- Use `IntersectionObserver` instead of scroll listeners
- Implement throttling for scroll-based state changes
- Reserve space for sticky elements to prevent layout shifts
- Fallback to non-sticky on older browsers

### 🔧 CSS Architecture Restructure
**Current Issue:** Single large CSS file (447 lines) approaching maintainability limits

**Proposed Structure:**
```
src/components/product/
├── ProductPageClient.tsx
├── ProductPageClient.module.css (layout only, ~100 lines)
├── buy-box/
│   ├── BuyBox.tsx
│   ├── BuyBox.module.css
│   ├── SizeSelector.tsx
│   ├── SizeSelector.module.css
│   ├── QuantityStepper.tsx
│   ├── QuantityStepper.module.css
│   └── ReassuranceBullets.tsx
├── gallery/
│   ├── ProductGallery.tsx
│   ├── ProductGallery.module.css
│   └── SizeGuideModal.tsx
└── content/
    ├── AccordionGroup.tsx
    ├── AccordionGroup.module.css
    └── ProductContent.tsx
```

## Desktop Layout Blueprint (Updated)

### Grid Structure (12-column)
```css
.productGrid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 400px; /* Gallery | Info */
  grid-template-areas: "gallery info";
  gap: var(--spacing-4xl);
  align-items: start;
}

@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  .productGrid {
    grid-template-columns: 1.2fr 0.8fr;
  }
}
```

### Left Column (Gallery): 7-8 cols
- **Vertical thumbnail strip** (left side, ~120px width)
- **Main image area** (remaining space, aspect ratio preserved)
- **Zoom/lightbox functionality** on image interaction
- **Sticky positioning** for desktop (position: sticky; top: 80px)

### Right Column (Info): 4-5 cols  
**Above Fold Hierarchy:**
1. **PDPHeader:** Title (h1) → Artist → Rating
2. **Price Display:** Large, prominent pricing
3. **SizeSelector:** Pills with cm/in mapping + size guide link
4. **QuantityStepper:** Grouped with CTA area
5. **PrimaryCTA:** Full-width Add to Cart button
